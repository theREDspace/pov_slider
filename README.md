Wordpress POV Slider
==========

A simple plugin for taking content from all over your site and marking it as "featured". Works as a simplified way to feature posts for (very) non-technical users.

Description
----------

This plugin was created out of necessity for a project where we had to set some content to be "featured". The client was unhappy with marking posts as "sticky" and wanted a single interface to manage all featured content.

The plugin shows the 50 most recent posts on the left hand side of the appearance screen page and the featured content on the right. You can simply drag and drop items from left to right and that order will be maintained in the 'pov_slider_featured_posts' option.

A search has been implemented to search further back than the 50 most recent posts.

In your theme, you can get the featured posts by using the `pov_slider_get_featured_posts` function.

Installation
----------

1. Upload the `pov_slider` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
